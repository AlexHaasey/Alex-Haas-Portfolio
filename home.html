                <h2>Background</h2>

                <p>My name is Alex Haas, and I am a filmmaker and photographer at the University of Miami. I am passionate about creating beautiful imagery that will immerse the viewer in the world I am documenting. This passion sparked at a young age and has completely overtaken my life, as I live through the lens of a camera. My journey has taken me from filming sports to music to travel, picking up every freelance job offered to me on the way. I have also began exploring content creation using AI products such as Kaiber and Runway, which has enhanced my work even further. My projects are fueled by curiosity, creativity and a deep desire to inspire individuals to explore the beautiful world around them.</p>
